  <h2>Accessibility for Web</h2>
  <p>About 15% internet-users in the World have disability: visual, physical or hearing disability.
  How to make website with accessibility for all of them?</p>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973">American Workforce Rehabilitation Act (section 508)</a> obliges us to think about people with disability
    but there are many situations when people without disability need it too. Let's take a closer look at how we can fix this.</p>

    <tr>
       <td>We can't use a mouse</td>
       <td><p>There is a simple, but strong rule: you have to add tabindex for all interactive elements on your page.</p>
       <p>Don't forget about icons and logo if they are lead to change page.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
       <td>We have small screen/we can't see</td>
       <td>It's very important to set alt tag for images. Write "beautiful girl on the beach near sea" instead of "girl.jpg".
       Set aria-label tag for links that were change on icons.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
       <td>Too small font</td>
       <td><p>It's not a good way to save space and put more information to the page.</p>
       <p>Take another look on the page. You have at least two option.</p>
       <p><span>First:</span> concise text: delete not important clarification and sentence that are inaccurate.</p>
       <p><span>Second:</span> if you can't do first, just add option "Read more" for users who are interested in.</p></td>

       <p>JavaScript-code is an addition on the base of HTML.</p></td>
